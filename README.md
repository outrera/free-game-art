## What about freesound.org

Freesound.org is being run by totally nutcase belgian asshole - Bram (https://freesound.org/people/Bram/), who positions himself as "Dictator For Life" and bans people for no reason. For example, Bram banned me for uploading a recording of burning my hamster alive to get authentic rodent agony sounds. He also bans other people out of dislike.

So yeah, if you like being gulaged by nasty dictators, then freesound.org would be the right place for you.

## What about OpenGameArt.org?
Unfortunately OpenGameArt.org curators believe that plundering open source repositories for art is unethical and damaging to site's reputation, even if license allows that. (Full story: http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/censored-broforce-sprites-and-game-ready)

Clint Bellanger has stated that well:
> We could instead only allow artists to upload their own art. Most other sites operate this way. It would remove any question about whether an artist is choosing the correct license or intending their art to be used in competing games. Then adding new art to OpenGameArt would be contacting an artist and inviting them to also share their art with us.

In other words OpenGameArt.org is more like gallery and community for artists, instead of being an archive of free game art, that programmers can easily use.

Further problem with OpenGameArt.org, is that they unscrupulously host assets stolen from non-free sources, like sound files Sound Ideas 6000, moreover, they've banned me when I pointed them that issue, and even began a coodinated attack against me, telling lies to github support to block my perfectly legal repositories: https://github.com/saniv/free-game-art/blob/master/foss-copyright-infringement-records.md

But wait! That doesn't end here, with OpenGameArt.org hosting stolen content, because at the same time they remove perfectly legal and potentially useful content, like say https://opengameart.org/content/you-know-i-had-to  - user heady.gavinl uploaded his photo under a very permissive public domain license, he even put some effort into cutting out background, so photo could be used as say a spectator in a racing game, or as an input for an algorithm that creates 3d character models from photos. Also that guy looks like Elliot Rodger, so we could have used that photo for a mad psycho character, without infringing on actual Elliot Rodger photos. But no! OpenGameArt.org would rather keep https://opengameart.org/content/tanks-1 and https://opengameart.org/content/simple-console-controller

Furthermore, OpenGameArt bans people and deletes questions (https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/unicode-characters-in-attribution-field) asking about unicode characters in attribution field and non-english languages names in general. For example, if you want to use say https://opengameart.org/content/fantasy-button
You have to credit its author, whose name is "ドリームキャスト", which leads to several problems:
1. You don't know what that means, maybe it is some insult and by including it in your game's credits it will get you banned, after some Chinese person reports its.
2. You most likely don't have unicode support in your game engine or a font to properly display that text. It would be too much to ask from an indie developer to implement proper i18n support.
3. International community is a wrong place for showing your nationalism and knowledge of obscure languages, unless you're trolling. Otherwise everyone starts writing in their native (or favorite) languages out of stubbornness. And no google translate will help.

Same for filenames, like in https://opengameart.org/content/old-music Can OGA guarantee that these Russian track names are not insulting to anyone? One can perfectly imagine Russian patriots uploading tracks like "Ukraine is Russian Soil.mp3" and turning the site into a propaganda device.

Contrary to OpenGameArt.org's curators, FreeGameArt collection doesn't care about ethics or morals, only about law. FreeGameArt also doesn't total containt crap-level art, which you can produce yourself in a paint.exe in less than a minute. So FreeGameArt will try to collect here free art inappropriate for OGA and the art, which original authors decided to pull out of free use or changed its distribution license to the less free one (the case with Monster Rpg 2).

Broforce sprites, in particular, are pesent too:
https://github.com/saniv/free-game-art/tree/master/sideview/broforce-sprites

As well as a few unique spirtes, like the isometric Wikipe-tan
https://github.com/saniv/free-game-art/blob/master/isometric-unsorted/wikipe-tan.png

And a few sprites drawn completely from scrach by myself:
https://github.com/saniv/free-game-art/blob/master/isometric-unsorted/sprites-by-nikita-sadkov.png

If you have free art which is inappropriate for OGA (i.e. CPL or BSD licensed artworks, like SpriteLib by Ari Feldman), you can send a pull request or FreeGameArt can link to your repository.

Enjoy!
