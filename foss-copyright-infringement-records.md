Open source community, being socialist-minded, is known to react dismissively at cases of copyright infringement. FOSS people were going as far as calling me "asshole" for pointing these issues. And still I have collected a few facts of illegal appropriation of intellectual property by FOSS community.

Open source developers rarely check the source of the assets. For example, several open source games (like ZeroK-RTS) appear to be using sounds from http://free-loops.com/pd-loops-1.html which is  full of illegal content, like the sounds taken from Sound Ideas (http://free-loops.com/2975-9mm-shotgun.html), Godzilla movies (http://free-loops.com/3006-godzilla.html) or Warcraft 2 (http://free-loops.com/3010-horse.html http://free-loops.com/3009-hello.html).


- opengameart.org hosts a lot of non-free content. There are assets clearly derived or stolen from non-free shows, as well as art re-licensed from non-free licenses.
    http://opengameart.org/content/fbi-chic (Dana Scully character from X-Files)
    http://opengameart.org/content/balloons-and-balls without credit uses crown icon http://www.allvectors.com/crown-vector/ which is Creative Commons Attribution, so cant be used as public domain. Then we find that allvectors.com steals vectors from commercial sources: http://www.microstockgroup.com/image-sleuth/allvectors-com-free-(stolen)-vectors-for-download!/ so this crown vector is not free at all.

for example, crown in  was relicensed from  ". so using it as Public Domain is a copytright infringement.
